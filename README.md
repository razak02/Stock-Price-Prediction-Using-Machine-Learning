# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Stock Price Prediction using sklearn, tensorflow, Long Short Term Memory Model, Python, Pandas, numpy and Matplotlib

The stock price of Starbucks (SBUX) was evaluated using data from yahoo finance for 5 years. Several models were attempted to get a fit - most of the regression models provide to be ineffective - wildly off with time series data set. The stock performance also has been very unsual - rapid increase in the last few months. After trying out several models, the Keras - sequential model - Long Short Term Memory NW model appeared to have a good fit due to its ability to look at past 60 days of stock closing data and validate it and predict. A RMS of 3.473 was obtained.
This appears to be a good starting point to further evaluate and explore.
Needs to be explored using more current models
